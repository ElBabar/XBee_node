# XBee_node
Node for CANbus and XBee commuincation

This node is a rackable board for a robot taking part in the Coupe de France de Robotique.

It allows the system to communicate using both CANbus and XBee, using a homemade adapter (see XBeeSX868_adapter).

You might need to use my library:

to your KiCad paths.
